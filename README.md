# Article Title: "AI may soon replace software engineers, says AWS CEO"

I found this article interesting since the title is misleading and suggests that AI will eliminate the need for software engineers. However, as the article explains the situation, it's revealed that AWS's CEO is referring to a role shift for software engineers. With new AI tools, software engineers won't have to focus as much on writing code but rather on innovation. I'm interested in what this would entail since there are already other positions which try to design and create unique and interesting for end users such as UX. Though at the current stage, AI can only be used to handle more of the routine coding work so engineers are still necessary to implement more complicated features.
